# JavaScript-PongGame

I have recently got back into writing programs in JavaScript using IntelliJ IDEA. I wanted to use my abilities to create a replica of the game Pong. I didn't have prior knowledge of how to do this in JS and I followed a tutorial on Udemy by GameKedo which helped me understand the mechanics to making a game of Pong in JS.

Files include;

pingpong.html 
pingpong.js

pingpong.html

- used to represent the game in w web format for browsers

pingpong.js

- used as the brains of the game, where the whole program is run, all the game variables, controls, actions are written in this file.
